\section{Computational results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section we present the new implementation for standard basis computation
over $\Z$ in \singular. We compare it to the current implementations in the
computer algebra systems \macaulay and \magma. For the comparison we use
benchmarks with different properties and behaviours. All examples are computed
with respect to the degree reverse lexicographical order. All algorithms run single
threaded, we use an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU with $3.4$ GHz
and $64$GB RAM. The machine runs Arch Linux with unmodified 4.18.12 kernel.

We can see that \singular's new implementation is always faster than \macaulay.
Comparing it to \magma we see that \magma is way faster for \texttt{Cyclic-7}.
We assume that this is due to \magma using Faug\`ere's F4
algorithm~(\cite{fF41999}): Our implementation considers less \spts and \gpts, but
the reduction steps in higher degree are way slower than the linear algebra done
in \magma. We believe that there are more classes of examples where the linear
algebra attempt is more efficient than the polynomial arithmetic used in
\singular, still, we need to investigate this problem in more detail.
Nevetheless, for most of the other examples considered, \singular is by a
factor faster than \magma, too.

For \singular we can see that generating all possible \spts and \gpts or only
the ones needed, recall Theorem~\ref{thm:buchberger-criterion}, does not have a
bigger influence on the computation. The main speed up lies in a faster
application of the product and the chain criteria since there are less pairs
generated which are then removed. On the other hand: Sometimes good reducers
are entered to $G$ later with this attempt. Since the most time for computing
standard bases over $\Z$ is consumed by the reduction steps and not the
criteria application, the impact is quite small.
