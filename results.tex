\section{Computational results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section we present the new implementation for standard basis computation
over Euclidean domains in \singular $4-1-2$.\footnote{Available in the \singular
sources since git commit 7d2091affbf4b4a1a382e5eb0a47f66c0f3c42f7a.}
We compare it to the current implementations in the
computer algebra systems \macaulay (version $1.12$) and \magma (version $2.23$).
For the comparison we use benchmarks with different properties and behaviours.
All examples are computed with respect to the degree reverse lexicographical order.
All algorithms run single threaded, we use an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU with $3.4$ GHz
and $64$GB RAM. The machine runs Arch Linux with unmodified 4.18.12 kernel.

We can see that \singular's new implementation is always faster than \macaulay.
Comparing it to \magma we see that \magma is way faster for \texttt{Cyclic-7}.
We assume that this is due to \magma using Faug\`ere's F4
algorithm~(\cite{fF41999}): Our implementation considers less \spts and \gpts, but
the reduction steps in higher degree are way slower than the linear algebra done
in \magma. We believe that there are more classes of examples where the linear
algebra attempt is more efficient than the polynomial arithmetic used in
\singular, still, we need to investigate this problem in more detail. We can see
that the F4 algorithm seems to be beneficial also for Mayr-42 and Yang-1.
Nevetheless, for most of the other examples considered, \singular is by a
factor faster than \magma, too.

In the above table we list timings for \macaulay's Buchberger implementation
usinge polynomial arithmetic (as for \singular).
We also tested \macaulay's F4 implementation, but in most of the above examples
it was slower or just as fast as the polynomial arithmetic implementation. Due
to its much higher memory usage, we could not finish most of the examples on the
given machine. The only example where we have seen a better result was Mayr-42
where \macaulay's F4 algorithm finished in $185$ seconds, still using way more
memory than \magma and nearly $20$ times as much as \singular. In all the given
example \singular's new algorithm uses, in general, the least memory of all
mentioned implementations.

For \singular we can see that generating all possible \spts and \gpts or only
the ones needed (recall Theorem~\ref{thm:buchberger-criterion}) does not have a
bigger influence on the computation. The main speed up lies in a faster
application of the product and the chain criteria since there are less pairs
generated which are then removed. On the other hand: Sometimes good reducers
are entered to $G$ later with this attempt. Since the most time for computing
standard bases over $\Z$ is consumed by the reduction steps and not the
criteria application, the impact is quite small.
